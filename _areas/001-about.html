                <p class="text-faded">Hi, I'm Yarny (Ru) and along with my son, the Ant, I run forest school in Fareham. <br>
                    So how did we get here?  <br>
                    I qualified as a secondary school teacher many moons ago, 
                    when my 3 boys were tiny and while I loved being with teenagers, 
                    I missed my own family. I moved to teaching adults and 
                    gained a little move work-life balance, until the COVID lockdowns hit 
                    and balancing anything became impossible. I had 3 children, at 3 different schools,
                    with 3 completely different sets of needs, including complex learning and social support needs, 
                    as well as trying to work and keep the house vaguely together.  <br>
                    When children started to head back into the classroom, 
                    we realised that now was the perfect time to change things up. 
                    No more coasting along for our mini-mathematician, 
                    no more social-struggles for the Ant. Lots of time outdoors, 
                    lots more learning and following our interests, lots of success.  <br>
                    We started attending a forest school for teens with the amazing Debbie Dragonfly. 
                    It was such a brilliant experience and it fitted so well with our approach to education.
                    It was just as much a transformational experience for the adults as for the children. <br>
                    Debbie encourage me to do my Forest School Leader qualification, 
                    and I started in May 2024. I'm just finishing up my last couple of assignments now (April 2025). <br> 
                    So here I am leading Forest School sessions for fellow home edders 
                    with the support of Rob in Wood, the owner of our lovely woodland, 
                    and my brilliant team of volunteers.
